Transfer Learning Based Gastrointestinal Disease Classification Using WCE Images

Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are common and, if not properly identified early on, can result in 
serious problems. 
Because capsule endoscopy can take detailed images of thedigestive tract, it has become an 
essential technique for GI
disease identification. However, manually analysing these images
is time consuming and is error prone. Traditional analysis of
gastrointestinal images is difficult due to their complexity, as well
as differences in lighting, texture, and structure. In medical
image classification, deep learning models—especially those
based on transfer learning—have demonstrated considerable
promise. This paper suggests a transfer learning-based method
for classifying gastrointestinal disorders using the
EfficientNetB2 model. The suggested model effectively extracts
complicated characteristics by utilizing pre-trained
convolutional layers. With a, precision of 0.9726, Area Under the
Curve of 0.9991 and recall of 0.9715, and overall accuracy of
0.9715, experimental findings show that the model performs
remarkably well. By allowing the fast and precise classification
of gastrointestinal disorders, these metrics demonstrate the way
the proposed method works to support better diagnostic
decision-making.
